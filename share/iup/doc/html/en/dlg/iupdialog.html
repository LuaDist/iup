<h2>IupDialog</h2>
<p>Creates a dialog element. It manages user interaction with the interface 
elements. For any interface element to be shown, it must be encapsulated in a 
dialog.</p>
  
<h3><a name="Creation">Creation</a></h3>

<pre>Ihandle* IupDialog(Ihandle *<strong>child</strong>); <em>[in C]</em>
iup.dialog{<strong>child</strong>: ihandle} -&gt; (<strong>elem</strong>: ihandle) <em>[in Lua]</em>
dialog(<strong>child</strong>) <em>[in LED]</em></pre>

<p><strong>child</strong>: Identifier of an interface element. The dialog has 
only one child.</p>
<p><u>Returns:</u> the identifier of the created element, or NULL if an error 
occurs.</p>

<p><strong>BORDER</strong> (<font SIZE="3">non inheritable</font>) (creation 
only): Shows a resize border around the dialog. Default: &quot;YES&quot;. BORDER=NO is 
useful only when RESIZE=NO, MAXBOX=NO, MINBOX=NO, MENUBOX=NO and TITLE=NULL, if 
any of these are defined there will be always some border.</p>
<p><a href="../attrib/iup_cursor.html">CURSOR</a> (<font SIZE="3">non

<p><strong>DROPFILESTARGET</strong> [Windows and GTK Only] (<font SIZE="3">non inheritable</font>): 
Enable or disable the drop of files. Default: NO, but if DROPFILES_CB is 
defined when the element is mapped then it will be automatically enabled.</p>

  <p><a href="../attrib/iup_expand.html">EXPAND</a> (<font SIZE="3">non 
	inheritable</font>): The default value is &quot;YES&quot;.</p>
<p><a href="../attrib/iup_size.html">SIZE</a> (<font SIZE="3">non inheritable</font>): 
Dialog’s size. Additionally the following values can also be defined for width 
and/or height: </p>
<ul>
	<li>&quot;FULL&quot;: Defines the dialog’s width (or height) equal to the screen's 
	width (or height)</li>
	<li>&quot;HALF&quot;: Defines the dialog’s width (or height) equal to half the 
	screen's width (or height)</li>

	screen's width (or height)</li>
</ul>
<p class="info">The dialog <strong>Natural</strong> size is only considered when 
the <strong>User</strong> size is not defined or when it is bigger than the
<strong>Current</strong> size. This behavior is different from a control that 
goes inside the dialog. Because of that, when SIZE or RASTERSIZE are set (changing the 
<strong>User</strong> size), the 
<strong>Current</strong> size is internally reset to 0x0, so the the <strong>Natural</strong> size 
can be considered when re-computing the <strong>Current</strong> size of the dialog.</p>
<p class="info">Values set at SIZE or RASTERSIZE attributes of a dialog are always 
accepted, regardless of the minimum size required by its children. For a dialog 
to have the minimum necessary size to fit all elements contained in it, simply 
define SIZE or RASTERSIZE to NULL. Also if you set SIZE or RASTERSIZE to be used 
as the initial size of the dialog, its contents will be limited to this size as 
the minimum size, if you do not want that, then after showing the dialog reset 
this size to NULL so the dialog can be resized to smaller values. But notice 
that its contents will still be limited by the <strong>Natural</strong> size, to 
also remove that limitation set SHRINK=YES.</p>
<p class="info">For more information see <a href="../layout_guide.html">Layout 
Guide</a>.</p>
<p><a href="../attrib/iup_title.html">TITLE</a> (<font SIZE="3">non inheritable</font>): 
Dialog’s title. Default: NULL. If you want to remove the title bar you must also 
set MENUBOX=NO, MAXBOX=NO and MINBOX=NO, before map. But in Motif and GTK it 
will hide it only if RESIZE=NO also.</p>
<p><a href="../attrib/iup_visible.html">VISIBLE</a>: Simply call <b>IupShow</b> 
or 
<b>IupHide</b> 
    for the dialog.</p>

<a href="../attrib/iup_dragdrop.html">Drag &amp; Drop</a> attributes and callbacks 
are supported.&nbsp;</p>


<h4>Exclusive</h4>
<p><strong>DEFAULTENTER</strong>:&nbsp; Name of the button activated when the 
user press Enter when focus is in another control of the dialog. Use <a href="../func/iupsethandle.html">
IupSetHandle</a> or
	<a href="../func/iupsetattributehandle.html">IupSetAttributeHandle</a> to 
associate a button to a name. </p>
<p><strong>DEFAULTESC</strong>: Name of the button activated when the user press 
Esc when focus is in another control of the dialog. Use <a href="../func/iupsethandle.html">
IupSetHandle</a> or
	<a href="../func/iupsetattributehandle.html">IupSetAttributeHandle</a> to 
associate a button to a name.</p>
<p><strong>DIALOGFRAME</strong>: Set the common decorations for modal dialogs. 
This means RESIZE=NO, MINBOX=NO and MAXBOX=NO. In Windows, if the PARENTDIALOG 
is defined then the MENUBOX is also removed, but the Close button remains.</p>
<p><a href="../attrib/iup_icon.html">ICON</a>: Dialog’s icon.</p>
<p><strong>FULLSCREEN: </strong>Makes the dialog occupy the whole screen over 
any system bars in the main monitor. All dialog details, such as title bar, 
borders, maximize button, etc, are removed. Possible values: YES, NO. In Motif 
you may have to click in the dialog to set its focus.<br>
      In Motif if set to YES when the dialog is hidden, then it can not be 
changed after it is visible.</p>

<p><strong>HWND</strong> [Windows Only] (<font size="3">non inheritable, 
read-only</font>): Returns the Windows Window handle. Available in the Windows 
driver or in the GTK driver in Windows.</p>

<p><strong>MAXBOX</strong> (creation only): Requires a maximize button from the 
window manager. If RESIZE=NO then MAXBOX will be set to NO. Default: YES. In 
Motif the decorations are controlled by the Window Manager and may not be 
possible to be changed from IUP. In Windows MAXBOX is hidden only if MINBOX is 
hidden as well, or else it will be just disabled.</p>
<p><strong>MAXSIZE</strong>: Maximum size for the dialog in raster units 
(pixels). The windowing system will not be able to change the size beyond this 
limit. Default: 65535x65535. (since 3.0)</p>
<p><strong>MENU</strong>: Name of a menu. Associates a menu to the dialog as a 
menu bar. The previous menu, if any, is unmapped. Use <a href="../func/iupsethandle.html">
IupSetHandle</a> or
	<a href="../func/iupsetattributehandle.html">IupSetAttributeHandle</a> to 
associate a menu to a name. See also <a href="../elem/iupmenu.html">IupMenu</a>.</p>
<p><strong>MENUBOX</strong> (creation only): Requires a system menu box from the 
window manager. If hidden will also remove the Close button. Default: YES. In 
Motif the decorations are controlled by the Window Manager and may not be 
possible to be changed from IUP. In Windows if hidden will hide also MAXBOX and 
MINBOX.</p>
<p><strong>MINBOX</strong> (creation only): Requires a minimize button from the 
window manager. Default: YES. In Motif the decorations are controlled by the 
Window Manager and may not be possible to be changed from IUP. In Windows MINBOX 
is hidden only if MAXBOX is hidden as well, or else it will be just disabled.</p>
<p><strong>MINSIZE</strong>: Minimum size for the dialog in raster units 
(pixels). The windowing system will not be able to change the size beyond this 
limit. Default: 1x1. Some systems define a very minimum size greater than this, 
for instance in Windows the horizontal minimum size includes the window 
decoration buttons. (since 3.0)</p>
<p><strong>MODAL</strong> (read-only): Returns the popup state. It is &quot;YES&quot; if 
the dialog was shown using <strong>IupPopup</strong>. It is &quot;NO&quot; if 
<strong>IupShow</strong> was used or it is not 
visible. (since 3.0)</p>
<p><strong>NATIVEPARENT</strong> (creation only): Native handle of a dialog to 
be used as parent. Used only if PARENTDIALOG is not defined.</p>
<p><a href="../attrib/iup_parentdialog.html">PARENTDIALOG</a> (creation only): 
Name of a dialog to be used as parent. </p>
<p><a name="PLACEMENT"><strong>PLACEMENT</strong></a>: Changes how the dialog 
will be shown. Values: &quot;FULL&quot;, &quot;MAXIMIZED&quot;, &quot;MINIMIZED&quot; and &quot;NORMAL&quot;. Default: 
NORMAL. After <strong>IupShow</strong>/<strong>IupPopup</strong> the attribute 
is set back to &quot;NORMAL&quot;. FULL is similar to FULLSCREEN but only the dialog 
client area covers the screen area, menu and decorations will be there but out 
of the screen. In UNIX there is a chance that the placement won't work 
correctly, that depends on the Window Manager.</p>
<p><strong>RESIZE</strong> (creation only): Allows interactively changing the 
dialog’s size. Default: YES. If RESIZE=NO then MAXBOX will be set to NO. In Motif the decorations are controlled by the 
Window Manager and may not be possible to be changed from IUP.</p>
<p><strong>SAVEUNDER</strong> [Windows and Motif Only] (creation only): When 
this attribute is true (YES), the dialog stores the original image of the 
desktop region it occupies (if the system has enough memory to store the image). 
In this case, when the dialog is closed or moved, a redrawing event is not 
generated for the windows that were shadowed by it. Its default value is YES. To 
save memory disable it for your main dialog. Not available in GTK.</p>
<p><a href="../attrib/iup_shrink.html">SHRINK</a>: Allows changing the elements’ 
distribution when the dialog is smaller than the minimum size. Default: NO.</p>
<p><strong>STARTFOCUS</strong>: Name of the element that must receive the focus 
right after the dialog is shown using <strong>IupShow</strong> or <strong>
IupPopup</strong>. If not defined then the first control than can receive the 
focus is selected (same effect of calling
<a href="../func/iupnextfield.html">IupNextField</a> for the dialog). Updated 
after SHOW_CB is called and only if the focus was not changed during the 
callback.</p>
<p><strong>XWINDOW</strong> [UNIX Only] (<font size="3">non inheritable, 
read-only</font>): Returns the X-Windows Window (Drawable). Available in the 
Motif driver or in the GTK driver in UNIX.</p>

<h4>Exclusive [Windows and GTK Only]</h4>

alpha value. Valid values range from 0 (completely transparent) to 255 (opaque). 
In Windows set to NULL to remove the LAYERED style bit. (GTK 2.12)</p>

<p><strong>TOPMOST</strong> [Windows and GTK Only]:&nbsp; puts the dialog always 
in front of all other dialogs in all applications. Default: NO.</p>

<h4>Exclusive Taskbar and Tray/Status Area [Windows and GTK Only]</h4>
<p><strong>HIDETASKBAR</strong> [Windows and GTK Only] (write-only): Action 
attribute that when set to &quot;YES&quot;, hides the dialog, but does not decrement the 
visible dialog count, does not call SHOW_CB and does not mark the dialog as 
hidden inside IUP. It is usually used to hide the dialog and keep the tray icon 
working without closing the main loop. It has the same effect as setting 
LOCKLOOP=Yes and normally hiding the dialog. IMPORTANT:
<font SIZE="3">when you hide using HIDETASKBAR, you must show using HIDETASKBAR 
also. </font>Possible values: YES, NO. </p>

<p><b>TRAY</b> [Windows and GTK Only]: When set to &quot;YES&quot;, displays an icon on 
the system tray. (GTK 2.10)</p>

<h3><a name="Notes">Notes</a></h3>

<p>Do not associate an <strong>IupDialog</strong> with the native &quot;dialog&quot; 
nomenclature in Windows, GTK or Motif. 
<strong>IupDialog</strong> use native standard windows in all drivers.</p>
<p>Except for the menu, all other elements must be inside a dialog to interact 
with the user. Therefore, an interface element will only be visible if its 
dialog is also visible.</p>
<p>The order of callback calling is system dependent. For instance, the 
RESIZE_CB and the SHOW_CB are called in a different order in Win32 and in 
X-Windows when the dialog is shown for the first time.</p>
<h4>Windows MDI</h4>
<p>The MDI support is composed of 3 components: the MDI frame window 
(IupDialog), the MDI client window (IupCanvas) and the MDI children (IupDialog). 
Although the MDI client is a IupCanvas it is not used directly by the 
application, but it must be created and included in the dialog that will be the 
MDI frame, other controls can also be available in the same dialog, like buttons 
and other canvases composing toolbars and status area. The following picture 
illustrates the e components:</p>
