<h2>IupLayoutDialog <span class="style1">(since 3.3)</span></h2>
<p>Creates a Layout Dialog. It is a predefined dialog to visually edit the 
layout of another dialog in run time. It is a standard <strong>IupDialog</strong> 
constructed with other IUP elements. The dialog can be shown with any of 
the show functions <strong>IupShow</strong>, <strong>IupShowXY</strong> or
<strong>IupPopup</strong>.</p>
<p>Any existent dialog can be selected. It does not need to be mapped on the 
native system nor visible. It could have been created in C, LED or Lua.</p>
<p>The layout dialog is composed by two areas: one showing the given dialog 
children hierarchy tree, and one displaying its layout.</p>
<p>This is a dialog intended for developers, so they can see and inspect their 
dialogs in other ways.</p>

<h4>Menu</h4>
<pre><strong>Dialog</strong>
	<strong>New</strong>  - creates a new empty dialog, it will be destroyed when the layout is destroyed.
	<strong>Load</strong> - loads an existent dialog from the application.
	<strong>Load Visible</strong> - lists only visible dialogs from the application to be loaded.
	<strong>Reload</strong> - reloads the current dialog into the Layout Dialog.
	<strong>Export</strong> - exports the current dialog to a text file in the specified language.
		<strong>C</strong>
		<strong>LED</strong>
		<strong>Lua</strong>
	<strong>Refresh</strong> - recalculates the dialog layout of the current dialog (IupRefresh).
	<strong>Redraw</strong> - send a redraw to the current dialog (IupRedraw).
	<strong>Show</strong> - shows the current dialog (IupShow) 
	<strong>Hide</strong> - hides the current dialog (IupHide) 
	<strong>Close</strong> - hides the Layout Dialog, optionally self destroy according to <strong>DESTROYWHENCLOSED</strong>.
<strong>Layout</strong>
	<strong>Hierarchy</strong> - shows or hides the layout hierarchy tree at left.
	<strong>Update</strong> - redraw the layout.
	<strong>Auto Update</strong> - periodically redraw the layout.
	<strong>Show Hidden</strong> - show hidden elements in the layout.
	<strong>Opacity</strong> - controls the Layout Dialog opacity so you can composite it on top of the selected dialog.</pre>
<p>Use <strong>Reload</strong> when the dialog has been changed and the layout 
was modified by the application. Use <strong>Update</strong> when attributes of 
the dialog were changed by the application and the layout needs to be redrawn.</p>
<p>The <strong>Export</strong> items will export only the dialog and its 
children. Associated elements such as menus and images will not be exported. The 
selected file will be overwritten if existent.</p>
<h4>Hierarchy Tree</h4>
<p>Each element inside the dialog is mapped to a node in the tree, and elements 
that are containers are branches in the tree. The node title shows the element 
class name, its TITLE attribute when available and its name when available. The 
selected node is synced with the selected element in the layout display in both 
ways. Using the right click over a node shows a context menu.</p>
<p>You can drag and drop items in the tree. But there are some restrictions 
according to each container possibilities. Some containers have internal 
children that are displayed but can not be changed.</p>
<h4>Layout Display</h4>
<p>The layout of an element is drawn with its Current size using its FONT, 
TITLE, BGCOLOR and FGCOLOR if any. But inheritance is not used intentionally to 
emphasize the element attributes. Only the first line (limited to 50 characters 
in the tree) is used from the element TITLE. Images are also used, but position 
of text and images are not the same as in the native control. This decoration is 
there simply to help locating the elements in the layout.</p>
<p>Containers that are not native elements are shown with dashed lines, other 
elements are shown with solid lines. When a red line is displayed along with a 
border of an element it means that element is maximizing its parent size, i.e. 
its <strong>Current</strong> size is equal to its <strong>Natural</strong> size 
and both are equal to the parent <strong>Client</strong> size. Usually this is 
the element determining the natural size of the container at least in the 
direction marked with red.</p>
<p>You can NOT drag and drop elements in the layout. Using the right click over 
an element shows a context menu, the same as in a tree node. When an element in 
the layout is double clicked and the actual element is visible, then the actual 
element will blink twice.</p>
<h4>Context Menu</h4>
<pre><strong>Properties</strong> - shows the properties dialog for the selected element.
<strong>Map</strong> - maps the selected element to the native system.
<strong>Unmap</strong> - unmaps the selected element from the native system. Its attribute are saved before unmapping.
<strong>Copy</strong> - copy the selected element to an i<span class="style3">nternal clipboard</span>. Its attributes are also copied.
<strong>Paste Child</strong> - paste the copied element as the first child of the selected container. 
<strong>Paste Brother</strong> - paste the copied element as brother of the selected element.
<strong>Add Child</strong> - adds a new element as the first child of the selected container. The new element is not mapped.
<strong>Add Brother</strong> - adds a new element as brother of the selected element. The new element is not mapped.
<strong>Remove</strong> - removes the selected element. </pre>
<h4>Properties</h4>
<p>The properties dialog allows the inspection and change of the elements 
attributes. It contains 3 Tab sections: one for the registered attributes of the 
element, one for custom attributes set at the hash table, and one for the 
callbacks. The callbacks are just for inspection, and custom attribute should be 
handled carefully because they may be not strings. Registered attributes values 
are shown in red when they were changed by the application. It uses the <a href="iupelementpropdialog.html">IupElementPropertiesDialog</a>.</p>

<p>This will create an empty layout with a new dialog.</p>

<p>The following dialog layout is displayed next.</p>
