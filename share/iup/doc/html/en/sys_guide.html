<h3><a name="init">Initialization</a></h3>
<p>Before running any of IUP’s functions, function <b>IupOpen</b> must be run to 
initialize the toolkit.</p>
<p>After running the last IUP function, function <b>IupClose</b> must be run so 
that the toolkit can free internal memory and close the interface system.</p>
<p>Executing these functions in this order is crucial for the correct 
functioning of the toolkit.</p>
<p>Between calls to the IupOpen and IupClose functions, the application can 
create dialogs and display them. </p>
<p>Therefore, usually an application employing IUP will have a code in the main 
function similar to the following:</p>
<pre>int main(int argc, char* argv[])
{
  if (IupOpen(&amp;argc, &amp;argv) == IUP_ERROR)
  {
    fprintf(stderr, &quot;Error Opening IUP.&quot;)
    return;
  }

  ...
  IupMainLoop();
  IupClose();

  return 0;
}</pre>
<h3><a name="led">LED</a></h3>
<p>LED is a dialog-specification language whose purpose is not to be a complete 
programming language, but rather to make dialog specification simpler than in C. </p>
<p>In LED, attributes and expressions follow this form:</p>
<p>elem = element[<b>attribute1=value1,attribute2=value2,</b>...](...expression...)</p>
<p>The names of the elements must not contain the “iup” prefix. Attribute values 
are always interpreted as strings, but they need to be in quotes (“…”) only when 
they include spaces. The “IUP_” prefix must not be added to the names of the 
attributes and predefined values. Expressions contain parameters for creating 
the element.<u1:p>
</u1:p>
<u1:p></u1:p>
</p>
<p>In LED there is no distinction between upper and lower case, except for 
attribute names.<u1:p>
</u1:p>
<u1:p></u1:p>
</p>
<p>Though the LED files are text files, there is no way to interpret a text in 
memory – there is only the IupLoad function, which loads a LED file and creates 
the IUP elements defined in it. Naturally, the same file cannot be loaded more 
than once, because the elements would be created again. This file interpretation 
does not map the elements to the native system.</p>
<p>The LED files are dynamically loaded and must be sent together with the 
application’s executable. However, this often becomes an inconvenience. To deal 
with it, there is the 
<a href="ledc.html">LEDC</a> compiler that creates a C module from the LED 
contents. </p>
<p>To simply view a LED file objects use the LED viewer application, see <b>
IupView</b> in the applications included in the distribution.
