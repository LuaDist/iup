<h1 align="center" style="text-align:center">Building Lua, IM, CD and IUP in 
Linux</h1>
<p>This is a guide to build all the Lua, IM, CD and IUP libraries in Linux. 
Notice that you may not use all the libraries, although this guide will show you 
how to build all of 
them. You may then choose to build specific libraries.</p>
<p>The Linux used as reference is the Ubuntu distribution.</p>
<h3>System Configuration</h3>
<p>To build the libraries you will have to download the development version of some packages installed 
on your system. Although the run time version of some of these packages are 
already installed, the development versions are usually not. The packages 
described here are for Ubuntu, but you will be able to identify them for other 
systems as well.</p>
<p>To build Lua you will need:</p>
			<pre>libreadline5-dev</pre>
		<p>To build IM you will need:</p>
			<pre>g++</pre>
		<p>To build CD you will need:</p>
<pre>libfreetype6-dev
libx11-dev
libxpm-dev
libxmu-dev
  libxft-dev (for the XRender driver, OPTIONAL)
libgtk2.0-dev (for the GDK driver)</pre>

<p>To build IUP you will need:</p>
<pre>libgtk2.0-dev (for the GTK driver) [already installed for CD]
  libmotif-dev and x11proto-print-dev (for the Motif driver, OPTIONAL)
libgl1-mesa-dev and libglu1-mesa-dev (for the IupGLCanvas)
libwebkitgtk-dev (for the IupWebBrowser)</pre>
<p>To install them you can use the Synaptic Package Manager and select the 
packages, or can use the command line and type:</p>
<pre>sudo apt-get install package_name</pre>
<h3>Source Download</h3>
<p>Download the &quot;xxx-X.X_Sources.tar.gz&quot; package from the &quot;<strong>Docs and Sources</strong>&quot; 
directory for the version you want to build. Here are links for the <strong>Files</strong> section 
in <strong>Source Forge</strong>:</p>
<p>Lua - <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/luabinaries/files/">
http://sourceforge.net/projects/luabinaries/files/</a><br>
IM - <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/imtoolkit/files/">
http://sourceforge.net/projects/imtoolkit/files/</a><br>
CD - <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/canvasdraw/files/">
http://sourceforge.net/projects/canvasdraw/files/</a><br>
IUP - <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/iup/files/">
http://sourceforge.net/projects/iup/files/</a></p>
<h3>Unpacking</h3>
<p>To extract the files use the tar command at a common directory, for example:</p>
<pre>mkdir -p xxxx
cd xxxx

[copy the downloaded files, to the xxxx directory]

tar -xpvzf lua5_1_4_Sources.tar.gz    [optional, see note below]
tar -xpvzf im-3.6.2_Sources.tar.gz
tar -xpvzf cd-5.4_Sources.tar.gz
tar -xpvzf iup-3.2_Sources.tar.gz
</pre>
<p>If you are going to build all the libraries, the makefiles and projects 
expect the following directory tree:</p>
<pre>/xxxx/
      lua5.1/    [optional, see note below]
      im/
      cd/
      iup/</pre>

<p>If you unpack all the source packages in the same directory, that structure will 
be automatically created.</p>
<p>If you want to use some of these libraries that are installed on the system 
(see Installation section below) you will have to define some environment 
variables before building them. For example:</p>
<pre class="example">export IM_INC=/usr/include/im
export IM_LIB=/usr/lib           [not necessary, already included by gcc]

export CD_INC=/usr/include/cd
export CD_LIB=/usr/lib           [not necessary, already included by gcc]

export IUP_INC=/usr/include/iup
export IUP_LIB=/usr/lib          [not necessary, already included by gcc]</pre>
<h3>Lua</h3>
<p>Although we use Lua from LuaBinaries, any Lua installation can also be used. 
In Ubuntu, the Lua run time package is:</p>
<pre>lua5.1</pre>
<p>And the Lua development package is:</p>
<pre>liblua5.1-0-dev</pre>
<p>To use them, instead of using the directory &quot;/xxxx/lua5.1&quot; described above, you will have to define some environment variables before building IM, CD and 
IUP:</p>
<pre class="example">export LUA_SUFFIX=
export LUA_INC=/usr/include/lua5.1</pre>
<h3>Building</h3>

<p>As a general rule (excluding system dependencies): IUP depends on CD and IM, 
and CD depends on IM. So start by build IM, then CD, then IUP.</p>
<p>To start building go the the &quot;<strong>src</strong>&quot; directory and type &quot;<strong>make</strong>&quot;. In IUP there are 
many &quot;srcxxx&quot; folders, so go to the up directory &quot;iup&quot; and type 
&quot;<strong>make</strong>&quot; that all the 
sub folders will be built. For example:</p>
<pre>cd im/src
make
cd ../..

cd cd/src
make
cd ../..

cd iup
make
cd ..</pre>
<p><strong>TIP</strong>: Instead of building all the libraries, try building only the libraries you 
are going to use. The provided makefiles will build all the libraries, but take 
a look inside them and you will figure out how to build just one library.</p>
<p><strong>TIP</strong>: If GTK headers or libraries are not being found, even 
when the libgtk2.0-dev package is installed, then their installation folder is 
not where our Makefiles expect. Build the GTK/GDK dependent libraries using 
&quot;make
<span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Helvetica&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;
mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;color:black;mso-ansi-language:PT-BR;
mso-fareast-language:PT-BR;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA">USE_PKGCONFIG=Yes&quot;.</span></p>
<h3>Pre-compiled Binaries</h3>
<p>Instead of building from sources you can try to use the pre-compiled 
binaries. Usually they were build in the latest Ubuntu versions for 32 and 64 
bits. The packages are located in the &quot;<strong>Linux Libraries</strong>&quot; 
directory 
under the <strong>Files</strong> section 
in <strong>Source Forge</strong>, with <strong>&quot;xxx-X.X_Linux26g4_lib</strong>.<strong>tar.gz&quot;</strong> 
and <strong>&quot;xxx-X.X_Linux26g4_64_lib.tar.gz&quot;</strong> names.</p>
<p>Do not extract different pre-compiled binaries in the same directory, create a 
subdirectory for each one, for example:</p>
<pre>mkdir im
cd im
tar -xpvzf ../im-3.6.2_Linux26g4_lib.tar.gz
cd ..

mkdir cd
cd cd
tar -xpvzf ../cd-5.4_Linux26g4_lib.tar.gz
cd ..

mkdir iup
cd iup
tar -xpvzf ../iup-3.2_Linux26g4_lib.tar.gz
cd ..
</pre>
<p>For the installation instructions below, remove the &quot;lib/Linux26g4&quot; from the 
following examples if you are using the pre-compiled binaries.</p>
<h3>Installation (System Directory)</h3>

<p>After building you can copy the libraries files to the system directory. If you are inside 
the main directory, to install the run time libraries you can type, for example:</p>
<pre>sudo cp -f im/lib/Linux26g4/*.so /usr/lib               [script version: <a href="../download/install">install</a> ]
sudo cp -f cd/lib/Linux26g4/*.so /usr/lib
sudo cp -f iup/lib/Linux26g4/*.so /usr/lib
</pre>
<p>To install the development files, 
then do:</p>
<pre>sudo mkdir -p /usr/include/im                           [script version: <a href="../download/install_dev">install_dev</a> ]
sudo cp -fR im/include/*.h /usr/include/im
sudo cp -f im/lib/Linux26g4/*.a /usr/lib

sudo mkdir -p /usr/include/cd
sudo cp -f cd/include/*.h /usr/include/cd
sudo cp -f cd/lib/Linux26g4/*.a /usr/lib

sudo mkdir -p /usr/include/iup
sudo cp -f iup/include/*.h /usr/include/iup             
sudo cp -f iup/lib/Linux26g4/*.a /usr/lib                               
</pre>
<p>Then in your makefile use -Iim -Icd -Iiup for includes. There is no need to 
specify the libraries directory with -L. Development files are only necessary if 
you are going to compile an application or library in C/C++ that uses there 
libraries. To just run Lua scripts they are not necessary.</p>
<h4>Installation (Build Directory) [Alternative]</h4>
<p>If you <strong>don't</strong> want to copy the run time libraries to your system 
directory, you can use them from build directory. You will need to add the run time 
libraries folders to 
the LD_LIBRARY_PATH (DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH in MacOSX), for example:</p>
<pre>export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/xxxx/im/lib/Linux26g4:/xxxx/cd/lib/Linux26g4:/xxxx/iup/lib/Linux26g4</pre>
<p>And in your makefile will will also need to specify those paths 
when linking using -L/xxxx/iup/lib/Linux26g4, and for compiling use 
-I/xxxx/iup/include.</p>
<h3>Installation (Lua Modules)</h3>
<p>Lua modules in Ubuntu are installed in the &quot;/usr/lib/lua/5.1&quot; 
directory. So to 
be able to use the Lua &quot;require&quot; with IUP, CD and IM you must create symbolic links inside 
that directory.</p>
<pre>sudo mkdir -p /usr/lib/lua/5.1                          [script version: <a href="../download/config_lua_module">config_lua_module</a> ]
cd /usr/lib/lua/5.1  
       
sudo ln -fs /usr/lib/libiuplua51.so iuplua.so
sudo ln -fs /usr/lib/libiupluacontrols51.so iupluacontrols.so
...</pre>
<p>Using those links you do not need any extra configuration. </p>
<h4>Installation (Lua Modules) [Alternative]</h4>
<p>If you use the <strong>alternative</strong> installation directory, and you also 
do NOT use the LuaBinaries installation, then you must set the LUA_CPATH environment variable:</p>
<pre>export LUA_CPATH=./\?.so\;./lib\?.so\;./lib\?51.so\;</pre>
<p><br>
