<h2>IupRefreshChildren<span class="style1"> (Since 3.3)</span></h2>
<p>Updates the size and layout of controls after changing size attributes. Can be used for any element inside a 
  dialog, only its children will be updated. It can change the layout of all the controls inside the 
given element because 
  of the dynamic layout positioning. </p>
<h3>
Parameters/Return</h3>
<pre>void IupRefreshChildren(Ihandle *<strong>ih</strong>); [in C]
iup.RefreshChildren(<strong>ih</strong>: ihandle) [in Lua]</pre>
<p><b>ih</b>: identifier of the interface element.</p>
<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>The given element must be a container. It must be inside a dialog hierarchy 
and must be mapped. It can not be a dialog. For dialogs use <strong>IupRefresh</strong>.</p>
<p>The children are immediately repositioned, if the dialog is visible then the 
change will be immediately reflected on the display.</p>
<p>This function will NOT change the size of the given element, even if the 
natural size of its children would increase its natural size.</p>
<p>If your dialog has too many controls and you want to hide or destroy some, 
then add some other in the same place, so you actually know that the dialog 
layout would not change, this is a much faster function than <strong>IupRefresh</strong>.</p>
