<h2 align="center" style="text-align:center">Comparing IUP with Other Interface Toolkits</h2>
<h3>Why to still maintain IUP if today we have so many other popular toolkits?</h3>
<p>This is a question we always ask to ourselves before going on for another year.</p>
<p>To answer that question we must first define the characteristics of the 
reference toolkit, list the available 
  toolkits and compare them with the reference and with IUP.</p>
<p>We would like a toolkit that has:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Portability.</b> That provides an abstraction for Graphical User Interface in Windows, UNIX and Macintosh. 
  Also called Cross platform and multi-platform GUI toolikit.</li>
  <li><b>Free License and Open Source.</b> This means that we can also produce commercial applications. The pure GPL 
    license can not be used but the LGPL can but must contain an exception stating that derived works in binary form may 
    be distributed on the user's own terms. This is a solution that satisfies those who wish to produce GPL'ed software 
    and also those producing proprietary software. Many libraries are distributed with this license combination.</li>
  <li><b>Small and Simple API. </b>This is rare. Many libraries assume that an Interface toolkit is also a synonymous 
    of a system abstraction and accumulate thousands of extra functions that are not related to User Interface. At 
    Tecgraf we like many small libraries instead of one big library. Almost all available toolkits today are in C++ 
    only, so C applications are excluded, also this means a hundred classes to include and understand each member 
    function. The use of attributes makes a lot of things more elegant and simpler to understand.</li>
  <li><b>Native Look &amp; Feel</b>. Many toolkits draw their own controls. This gives an uniformity among systems, but 
    also a disparity among the available applications in the same system. Native controls are also faster because they 
    are drawn by the system. But the problem is what's &quot;native&quot; in UNIX? Some commercial applications in UNIX start 
    using Motif as the &quot;native&quot; option. It was the official standard but because of license restrictions, before the 
    OpenMotif event, the system became old and some good alternatives were developed, including GTK and Qt.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Discussion</h3>
<p>FOX has a great look but the license can be restrictive in some cases. </p>
<p>FLTK promises a new version with a better look and new features, but there 
are no concrete release dates. The FLTK 
  documentation also does not help.</p>
<p>GTK+ can be used as a replacement for Motif, but not as a fully &quot;portable&quot; toolkit since 
it is was originally target for 
  X-Windows. Nowadays GTK+ 2 is a great free C toolkit. But some predefined dialogs could be the native ones, like the 
  File Selection, specially in Windows. The Windows port has a look and feel 
very similar to the 
Windows native look and feel, but it is different from a native application. A MacOS X port without using X-Windows is on 
the way, but very slowly. Unfortunately the Windows port has been orphan for 
some time and there is no release of new binaries for a while.</p>
<p>Qt had several license limitations, but since mid 2009 a new license model 
take place and it became more attractive. It is a very stable and powerful 
toolkit. </p>
<p>wxWidgets is an excellent choice because of the native controls and its 
portability.</p>
<p>It is hard to compare IUP with wxWidgets and Qt since they are much more than an 
User Interface Toolkit. They are 
  complete development platforms that include several secondary libraries not related to User Interface. In IUP we focus 
  only in Graphical User Interface.</p>
<h3>Developing IUP</h3>
<p>IUP has a C API, only has functions for Graphical User Interface, and uses &quot;Native Controls&quot; in Windows, Motif and 
  GTK+. These are the major differences between IUP and other toolkits. Because of that IUP is small, fast and very 
  powerful.</p>
<p>We have a small but very active team and we have many Tecgraf and foreign applications that today use IUP, 
  collaborating for its evolution. Our objective is to surpass the Tecgraf needs, keeping backward compatibility and 
  improving the internal code.</p>
<p>IUP does not have a wide localization feature, it only includes support for messages in English and Portuguese. And 
  it does not have support for Unicode characters.</p>
<p><b>Why Not Mac? </b>The first Mac driver was developed for MacOS 9 and had several memory limitations so it was 
  abandoned. With Mac OS X we have the opportunity to do something better. Today IUP runs on Mac OS X using X11 
with 
  Motif or GTK. We plan for the future to build a native driver, but it is not a 
Tecgraf priority.</p>
<p><b>Why Still Motif? </b>Motif is very important for non Linux systems, some Tecgraf applications run on 
old AIX, SGI 
  and Sun systems, that only have Motif installed and we can not force the installation of other toolkits like GTK.
