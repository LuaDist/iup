<h2>IupTree Attributes</h2>
<h3><a name="global">General</a></h3>
<p><strong>ADDEXPANDED</strong> (<font size="3">non inheritable</font>):
  Defines if branches will be expanded when 
  created. The branch will be actually expanded when it receives the first 
child. Possible values: &quot;YES&quot; =
    The branches will be created expanded; &quot;NO&quot; =
    The branches will be created collapsed. Default:
    &quot;YES&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>ADDROOT</strong> (<font size="3">non inheritable</font>): 
automatically adds an empty branch as the first node when the tree is mapped. 
Default: &quot;YES&quot;. (Since 3.1)</p>
<p><strong>AUTOREDRAW</strong> [Windows] (<font size="3">non inheritable</font>): 
automatically redraws the tree when something has change. Set to NO to add many 
items to the tree without updating the display. Default: &quot;YES&quot;. (since 3.3)</p>

<p><a href="../attrib/iup_bgcolor.html">BGCOLOR</a>: Background color of the 
tree. Default: the global attribute TXTBGCOLOR.</p>

  
<p><strong>CANFOCUS</strong> (creation only) (<font size="3">non inheritable</font>): enables the focus traversal of the control. In Windows the control will still get the focus when clicked. Default: YES. (since 3.0)</p>

  
<p><strong>COUNT</strong> (read only) (<font size="3">non inheritable</font>): returns the total number of 
nodes in the 
tree. (since 3.0)</p>

  
<p><strong>DROPFILESTARGET</strong> [Windows and GTK Only] (<font SIZE="3">non inheritable</font>): Enable or disable the drop of 
<span class="style5">files</span>. Default: NO, but if DROPFILES_CB is defined when the element is mapped 
then it will be automatically enabled. This is NOT related to the drag&amp;drop of 
nodes inside the tree. (since 3.0)</p>
<p><strong>DROPEQUALDRAG</strong> (<font SIZE="3">non inheritable</font>): if 
enabled will allow a drop node to be equal to the drag node. Used only if SHOWDRAGDROP 
=Yes. In the case the nodes are equal the callback return value is ignored and 
nothing is done after. (since 3.3)</p>

  
<p><a href="../attrib/iup_expand.html">EXPAND</a> (<font size="3">non inheritable</font>): 
The default value is &quot;YES&quot;.</p>

<p><strong>FGCOLOR</strong>: default text foreground color. Once each node is 
created it will not change its color when FGCOLOR is changed. Default: the global 
attribute TXTFGCOLOR. (since 3.0)</p>

  
<p><strong>HIDEBUTTONS</strong> (creation only): hide the expand and collapse 
buttons. In GTK, branches will be only expanded programmatically. In Motif it did 
not work and crash the test. (since 3.0) (GTK 2.12)</p>

  
<p><strong>HIDELINES</strong> (creation only): hide the lines that connect the 
nodes in the hierarchy. (since 3.0) (GTK 2.10)</p>
<p><strong>INDENTATION</strong>: sets the indentation level in pixels. The visual 
effect of changing the indentation is highly system dependent. In GTK it acts as 
an additional indent value, and the lines do not follow the extra indent. In Windows 
is limited to a minimum of 5 pixels. (since 3.0)&nbsp; (GTK 2.12)</p>

  
<p> 
<a href="../attrib/iup_rastersize.html">RASTERSIZE</a> (<font size="3">non inheritable</font>): 
the initial size is &quot;400x200&quot;. Set to NULL to allow the automatic 
layout use smaller values.</p>
<p><strong>SHOWDRAGDROP</strong> (creation only) (<font size="3">non inheritable</font>): Enables the 
internal drag and drop of 
nodes, and enables the <strong>DRAGDROP_CB</strong> callback. Default:
  &quot;NO&quot;. Works only if MARKMODE=SINGLE.</p>
<p><strong>SHOWTOGGLE </strong>(creation only) (<font size="3">non inheritable</font>): enables the use of toggles for all nodes of the 
tree. Can 
  be "YES", &quot;3STATE&quot; or NO". Default: "NO". In Motif Versions 2.1.x and 2.2.x, the images 
are disabled (toggle and text only are drawn in nodes of the tree). (since 3.6)</p>

<p><strong>SPACING</strong>: vertical internal padding for each node. Notice that the distance between each 
node will be actually 2x the spacing. (since 3.0)</p>

  
<p><strong>TOPITEM</strong> (write-only): position the given node identifier at the top of 
the tree or near to make it visible. If any parent node is collapsed then they 
are automatically expanded. (since 3.0)</p>

<p>
The NAME common attribute is still not supported because of a backward 
compatibility code. Old applications must change the use of the old NAME 
attribute to TITLE, so the new NAME common attribute can be enabled in future 
versions.</p>

<h3><a name="nodes">Nodes</a>&nbsp; (<font size="3">non inheritable</font>)</h3>
    <p>For these attributes &quot;id&quot; is the specified node identifier. If 
	&quot;id&quot; is 
	empty or invalid, then the focus node is used as the specified node. </p>
<p><strong>CHILDCOUNTid</strong> (read only): returns the immediate children 
	count of the specified branch. It 
	does not count children of child that are branches. (since 3.0)</p>
<p><strong>COLORid</strong>: text foreground color of the specified node. The value should be a string in the format &quot;R G B&quot; where R, G, B are numbers 
  from 0 to 255.</p>
<p><strong>DEPTHid </strong>(read only): returns the depth of the specified 
node. The first node has depth=0, its 
immediate children has depth=1, their children has depth=2 and so on.</p>
<p><strong>KINDid </strong>(read only):

	<a href="../func/iupsetattributehandle.html">IupSetAttributeHandle</a> to 
	associate an image to a name. See also <a href="iupimage.html">IupImage</a>. 
In Windows and Motif set the BGCOLOR attribute before setting the image. If node 
is a branch it is used when collapsed.</p>
<p><strong>IMAGEEXPANDEDid</strong>:
  same as the IMAGE attribute but used for expanded branches.</p>
<p><strong>IMAGELEAF</strong>:
  the image name that will be shown for all 
  leaves. Default: &quot;IMGLEAF&quot;. Internal values &quot;IMGBLANK&quot; and &quot;IMGPAPER&quot; are

    &quot;IMGEXPANDED&quot;. If BGCOLOR is set the image is automatically 
updated.</p>
<h3><a name="focus">Focus Node</a></h3>
<p><strong>VALUE</strong> (<font size="3">non inheritable</font>):
  The focus node identifier. When retrieved but there isn't a node with focus it 
returns 0 if there are any nodes, and returns -1 if there are no nodes. When 
changed and MARKMODE=SINGLE the node is also selected. The tree is 
always scrolled so 
the node becomes visible. In Motif the tree will also receive the focus.Additionally accepts the values:</p>
<blockquote>

&quot;NEXT&quot;:
      the next visible node, one node after the focus node. If at the last does nothing<br>
&quot;PREVIOUS&quot;: the previous visible node, one node before the focus node. If at the 
first does nothing<br>
&quot;PGDN&quot;: the next visible node, ten nodes node after the focus node. If 
at the last does nothing <br>
&quot;PGUP&quot;: the previous visible node, ten nodes before the focus node. If 
at the first does nothing</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><a name="marks0">Marks</a></h3>
<p><strong>MARK</strong> (write only) (<font size="3">non inheritable</font>): Selects a range 
of nodes in the format &quot;start-end&quot; (%d-%d). Allowed only when 
MARKMODE=MULTIPLE. Also accepts the values:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="info"><span class="style3">&quot;INVERTid&quot;:
      Inverts the specified node mark state, where id is the specified node 
identifier. If id is empty or invalid, then the focus node is used as reference node. 
</span> <br>
&quot;BLOCK&quot;: Marks all nodes between the focus node and the initial block-marking 
node defined by MARKSTART<br>
&quot;CLEARALL&quot;:
      Unmark all nodes<br>
&quot;MARKALL&quot;:
      Marks all nodes<br>
&quot;INVERTALL&quot;:
      Inverts the marking of all nodes</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MARKEDid</strong> (non inheritable): The selection state of the 
specified node, where id is the specified node identifier. If id is empty or 
invalid, then 
the focus node is used as reference node. Can be: YES or NO. Default: NO</p>
<p><strong>MARKEDNODES</strong> (non inheritable): The selection state of all 
nodes when MARKMODE=MULTIPLE. It is/accepts a sequence of '+' and '-' symbols 
indicating the state of each item ('+'=selected, '-'=unselected. When setting 
this value, if the number of specified symbols is smaller than the total count 
then the remaining nodes will not be changed. (since 3.1)</p>
<p><strong>MARKMODE</strong>: defines how the nodes can be 
selected. Can be: 
SINGLE or MULTIPLE. Default: SINGLE.</p>
<p><strong>MARKSTART</strong> (<font size="3">non inheritable</font>):
  Defines the initial node for the block 
  marking, used when MARK=BLOCK. The value must be the node identifier.
    Default:
    0 (first node).</p>
<p><strong>TOGGLEVALUEid</strong> (<font size="3">non inheritable</font>): 
defines the toggle's state. Values can be &quot;ON&quot; or &quot;OFF&quot;. If 
SHOW3STATE=YES then can 
also be &quot;NOTDEF&quot;. Default: &quot;OFF&quot;.</p>
<h3><a name="tree">Hierarchy</a>&nbsp; (<font size="3">non inheritable</font>)</h3>
    <p>For these attributes &quot;id&quot; is the specified node identifier. If 
	&quot;id&quot; is 
	empty or invalid, then the focus node is used as the specified node. </p>
<p><strong>ADDLEAF</strong><b>id</b><strong> </strong>(write only):
  Adds a new leaf 
after the reference node, where id is the reference node identifier. Use id=-1 to add 
before the first 
node. The value is used as the 
text label of the new node. The id of the new node will be the id of the 
reference node + 1. 
  The attribute <strong>LASTADDNODE</strong> is set to the new id. The reference node is marked and all others unmarked. The reference node 
position remains the same. If the reference node does not exist, nothing 
happens. If the reference node is a branch then the depth of the new node is one 
depth increment from the depth of the reference node, if the reference node is a 
leaf then the new node has the same depth. If you need to 
add a node after a specified node but at a different depth use <strong>
INSERTLEAF</strong>. Ignored if set before map. </p>
<p><strong>ADDBRANCHid </strong>(write only):
  Same as <strong>ADDLEAF</strong> for branches. Branches can be created 
expanded or collapsed depending on <strong>ADDEXPANDED</strong>. Ignored if set 
before map. </p>

<p><strong>COPYNODEid </strong>(write only): Copies a node and its children, 
where id is the specified node identifier. The value is the destination node identifier. If 
the destination node is a branch and it is expanded, then the specified node is 
inserted as the first child of the destination node. If the branch is not 
expanded or the destination node is a leaf, then it is inserted as the next 
brother of the leaf. The specified node is not changed. All node attributes are 
copied, except user data. Ignored if set before map. (since 3.0)</p>

<p><strong>DELNODEid </strong>(write only):
  Removes a node and/or its children, where id is the specified node identifier. 
Ignored if set before map. Possible values:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
  <li>&quot;ALL&quot;: deletes all nodes, id is ignored (Since 3.1)</li>
	<li>&quot;SELECTED&quot;:
    deletes the specified node and its children</li>
  <li>&quot;CHILDREN&quot;:
    deletes only the children of the 
  specified node</li>
  <li>&quot;MARKED&quot;:
    deletes all the selected nodes (and all their 
    children), id is ignored</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>EXPANDALL </strong>(write only): expand or contracts all nodes. Can 
be YES (expand all), or NO (contract all). (since 3.0)</p>

<p><strong>INSERTLEAFid</strong>, <strong>INSERTBRANCHid </strong>
(write only): Same as <strong>ADDLEAF</strong> and <strong>ADDBRANCH</strong> but 
the depth of the new node is always the same of the reference node. If the 
reference node is a leaf, then the id of the new node will be the id of the 
reference node + 1. If the reference node is a branch the id of the new node 
will be the id of the reference node + 1 + the total number of child nodes of 
the reference node. (since 3.0)</p>

<p><strong>MOVENODEid </strong>(write only): Moves a node and its children, 
where id is the specified node identifier. The value is the destination node identifier. If 
the destination node is a branch and it is expanded, then the specified node is 
inserted as the first child of the destination node. If the branch is not 
expanded or the destination node is a leaf, then it is inserted as the next 
brother of the leaf. The specified node is removed. User data and all node 
attributes are preserved. Ignored if set before map. (since 3.0)</p>
<h3><a name="edit">Editing</a></h3>
<p><b>RENAME </b>(write only): Forces a rename action to take place. Valid only 
when SHOWRENAME=YES.</p>

<p><span class="style4">RENAMECARET</span><b> </b>(write only):
  the caret&#8217;s 
  position of the text box when in-place renaming. Same as the CARET attribute 
for <a href="iuptext.html#Attributes">IupText</a>, but here is used only once 
after SHOWRENAME_CB is called and before the text box is shown.</p>
<p><span class="style4">RENAMESELECTION</span><b> </b>(write only):
  the selection 
  interval 
  of the text box when in-place renaming. Same as the SELECTION attribute for
<a href="iuptext.html#Attributes">IupText</a>, but here is used only once after SHOWRENAME_CB 
is called and before the text box is shown.</p>
<p><strong>SHOWRENAME</strong> (creation in Windows) (<font size="3">non inheritable</font>): Allows the in place rename of a 
node. Default:
  &quot;NO&quot;. Since IUP 3.0, F2 and clicking twice only starts to rename a 
node if SHOWRENAME=Yes. In Windows must be set to YES before map, but can be 
changed later (since 3.3).</p>
