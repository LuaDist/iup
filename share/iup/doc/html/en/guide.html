<h3><a name="start">Getting Started</a></h3>
<p>IUP has four impor<u1:p>tant concepts that are implemented in a very 
different way from other toolkits. 
</u1:p></p>
<p>
<u1:p>First is the control creation timeline. When a control is created it is 
not immediately mapped to the native system. So some attributes will not work 
until the control is mapped. The mapping is done when the dialog is shown or 
manually calling <b>IupMap</b> for the dialog. You can not map a control without 
inserting it into a dialog.</u1:p></p>
<p>Second is the attribute system. IUP has only a few functions because it uses 
string attributes to access the properties of each control. So get used to <b>
IupSetAttribute</b> and <b>IupGetAttribute</b>, because you are going to use 
them a lot.</p>
<p>Third is the abstract layout positioning. IUP controls are never positioned 
in a specific (x,y) coordinate inside the dialog. The positioning is always 
calculated dynamically from the abstract layout hierarchy. So get used to the 
<b>IupFill</b>, <b>IupHbox</b> and <b>IupVbox</b> controls that allows you to 
position the controls in the dialog.</p>
<p>Fourth is the callback system. Because of the LED resource files IUP has an 
indirect form to associate a callback to a control. You associate a C function 
with a name using <b>IupSetFunction</b>, and then associate the callback 
attribute with that name using <b>IupSetAttribute</b>. But applications now 
should use the 
<b>IupSetCallback</b> 
  function to directly associate a callback for a control.&nbsp; </p>
<p>LED is the original IUP resource file which has been deprecated in favor of 
Lua files. But keep in mind that you 
<u>can</u> use IUP without using LED or Lua, using only the C API.</p>
<h3><a name="apl">Building Applications</a></h3>
<p>To compile programs in C, simply include file <b>iup.h</b>. If the 
application only uses functions from IUP and other cross-platform libraries that 
have the same API in all platforms, then the application 
immediately becomes platform independent. The implementation of the IUP functions is different in each platform 
and the linker is in charge of solving the IUP functions using the library specified 
in the project/makefile. For further information on how to link your 
application, please refer to the specific driver documentation.<u1:p>
</u1:p>
</p>
<p>IUP can also work together with other interface toolkits. The main problem is 
the 
<strong>IupMainLoop</strong> function. If you are going to use only Popup 
dialogs, then it is very simple. But to use non modal dialogs without the 
<strong>IupMainLoop</strong> you must call <strong>IupLoopStep</strong> from 
inside your own message loop. Also it is not possible to use Iup controls with 
dialogs from other toolkits and vice-versa.</p>
<p>The generation of applications is highly dependent on each system, but at 
least the 
<b>iup</b> 
  library must be linked.</p>
<p>To use the additional controls you will need the 
<b>iupcontrols</b> and <strong>iupcd</strong> libraries and the CD library 
<b>cd</b>.</p>
<p>Other controls are available in secondary libraries, they also may have other 
external dependencies, check the documentation of the control.</p>
<p>If you are using IUP libraries in Windows DLLs or in Posix SOs dynamic 
libraries, then it is not necessary to worry about secondary dependencies, only 
specify the libraries you directly use. If you link to the static libraries then 
you must include all the secondary dependencies.</p>
<p>To use the Lua Binding, you need to link the program with the <b>iuplua</b> 
library and with the <b>lua </b>library. The other secondary libraries also have 
their Lua binding libraries that must be linked to use the control in Lua.</p>
<p>The download files list includes the <a href="download_tips.html">
Tecgraf/PUC-Rio Library Download Tips</a> 
  document, with a description of all the available binaries.</p>
<h4>Windows</h4>
<p>In Windows, if you statically link the application with IUP you must link also with the libraries 
  <b>ole32.lib</b>
  and <b>comctl32.lib</b> (provided with the compilers). The <b>iup.rc</b> 
resource file (or a custom version) should be included in the application's project/makefile so that 
some icons and cursors can be used when not using the DLLs and to enable Windows 
Visual Styles. <b>iup.rc</b> is located in &quot;/etc&quot; folder of the distribution.</p>
<p>There is also guides for using some IDEs: <a href="ide_guide/cppbx.html">C++ 
Builder X</a>,&nbsp;
  <a href="ide_guide/dev-cpp.html">Dev-C++</a>,&nbsp; <a href="ide_guide/owc.html">
OpenWatcom C++</a>,
  <a href="ide_guide/msvc.html">Visual C++ 7 (Visual Studio 2003)</a>,
  <a href="ide_guide/msvc8.html">Visual C++ 8 (Visual Studio 2005)</a>,
<a href="ide_guide/codeblocks.html">Code Blocks</a> and <a href="ide_guide/eclipse.html">
Eclipse for C++</a>.</p>
<p>In Windows, when using Gcc to link an application the libraries order are as 
important as in UNIX. Always put the less dependent library at the end, for 
example:</p>
<pre>-liup -lgdi32 -lcomdlg32 -lcomctl32 -lole32</pre>
<h4>Motif</h4>
<p>In Motif, IUP uses the Motif (Xm), the Xtoolkit (Xt) and the Xlib (X11) 
libraries. To statically link an application with IUP, use the following options in the 
linker call (in the same order): </p>
<pre>-liup -lXm -lXmu -lXt -lX11 -lm</pre>
<p>Though these are the minimum requirements, depending on the platform other 
libraries might be needed. Typically, they are X extensions (Xext), needed in 
SunOS, and Xpm (needed in Linux only). They must be listed after Xt and before 
X11. For instance: </p>
<pre>-liup -lXm -lXpm -lXmu -lXt -lXext -lX11 -lm</pre>
<p>Usually these libraries are placed in default directories, but you may 
require additional options: </p>
  <table align="center">
    <tr>
      <td width="145">Linux</td>
      <td width="434">-L/usr/X11R6/lib -I/usr/X11R6/include</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td width="145">IRIX</td>
      <td width="434">-L/usr/lib32 (X11)<br>
		-L/usr/Motif-2.1/lib32 -I/usr/Motif-2.1/include (Motif)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td width="145">SunOS</td>
      <td width="434">-L/usr/openwin/lib -I/usr/openwin/share/include (X11)<br>
		-L/usr/dt/lib -I/usr/dt/share/include (Motif)</td>
    </tr>
    </table>
<h4>GTK+ (since 3.0)</h4>
<p>In UNIX it will need the X-Windows libraries just like the Motif driver. And 
in UNIX or in Windows it will need the &quot;iupgtk&quot; library and the following GTK+ 
libraries:</p>
<pre><b>gtk-win32-2.0 gdk-win32-2.0</b> gdk_pixbuf-2.0 pango-1.0 <b>pangowin32-1.0</b> gobject-2.0 gmodule-2.0 glib-2.0
   or
<b>gtk-x11-2.0 gdk-x11-2.0</b> gdk_pixbuf-2.0 pango-1.0 <b>pangox-1.0</b> gobject-2.0 gmodule-2.0 glib-2.0</pre>
<p>In UNIX the following INCLUDES paths are necessary:</p>
<pre>/usr/include/atk-1.0 /usr/include/gtk-2.0 /usr/include/cairo /usr/include/pango-1.0 /usr/include/glib-2.0 
and eventually:   /usr/lib/glib-2.0/include /usr/lib/gtk-2.0/include
             or   /usr/lib64/glib-2.0/include /usr/lib64/gtk-2.0/include</pre>
<h4>Multithread</h4>
<p>User interface is usually not thread safe and IUP is not thread safe. The 
general recommendation when you want more than one thread is to build the 
application and the user interface in the main thread, and create secondary 
threads that communicates with the main thread to update the interface. The 
secondary threads should not directly update the interface.</p>
<h4>Dynamic Loading</h4>
<p>Although we have dynamic libraries we do not recommend the dynamic loading of 
the main IUP library in Motif. This is because it depends on Motif and X11, you 
will have to load these libraries first. So it is easier to build a base 
application that already includes X11, Motif and the main IUP library than 
trying to load them all. In Windows this is not a problem.</p>
<p>The IUP secondary libraries can be easily dynamic loaded regardless of the 
system.</p>
<h3><a name="buildlib">Building The Library</a></h3>
<p>In the Downloads you will be able to find pre-compiled binaries for many 
platforms, all those binaries were built using Tecmake. Tecmake is a command 
line multi compiler build tool based on GNU make, available at
  <a target="_blank" href="http://www.tecgraf.puc-rio.br/tecmake">
http://www.tecgraf.puc-rio.br/tecmake</a>. Tecmake is used by all the Tecgraf 
libraries and many applications.</p>
<p>You do not need to install Tecmake, scripts for Posix and Windows systems are already included in the source code package. Just type &quot;make&quot; 
in the command line on the main folder and all libraries and executables will be 
build.</p>
<p>In Linux, check the &quot;<a href="building.html">Building Lua, IM, CD and IUP in 
Linux</a>&quot; guide.</p>
<p>In Windows, check the &quot;<a href="buildwin.html">Building Lua, IM, CD and IUP in 
Window</a>&quot; guide.</p>
<p>If you decide to install Tecmake, the Tecmake configuration 
files (*.mak) are available at the &quot;src*&quot; folders, and are very easy to understand. 
In the<b> </b>main folder, and in each source folder, there are files 
named 
<i>make_uname.bat</i> that build the libraries using <b>Tecmake</b>. To build 
for Windows using Visual C 9.0 (2008) for example, just execute <i>&quot;make_uname 
vc9&quot;</i> in the iup main folder, or for the DLLs type <i>
&quot;make_uname dll9&quot;</i>. The Visual Studio workspaces with the respective projects 
available in the source package is for debugging purposes only.</p>
<p><b>IUP</b> runs on many different systems and interact with many different 
libraries such as
  <a href="http://www.opengroup.org/openmotif/" target="_blank">Motif</a>, 
<a href="http://www.opengl.org">OpenGL</a>,
  <a href="http://www.tecgraf.puc-rio.br/cd" target="_blank">Canvas Draw (CD)</a> 
and
  <a href="http://www.lua.org" target="_blank">Lua</a>. You have to install some 
these libraries to build the secondary IUP libraries. Make sure you have all the 
dependencies for the library you want installed, see the documentation below.</p>
<p>If you are going to build all the libraries, the makefiles and projects 
expect the following directory tree:</p>
<pre>/mylibs/
        iup/
        cd/
        im/
        lua5.1/</pre>
<p>To control that location set the TECTOOLS_HOME environment variable to the 
folder were the CD, IM and Lua libraries are installed.</p>
<p>IUP_ASSERT can be defined to enable some runtime checks for the main API.</p>

(*) In Windows, &quot;<strong>iupwin</strong>&quot; is called &quot;<strong>iup</strong>&quot;. 
    In Linux and BSD &quot;<strong>iupgtk</strong>&quot; is called &quot;<strong>iup</strong>&quot;. 
    In IRIX, AIX and SunOS &quot;<strong>iupmot</strong>&quot; is called &quot;<strong>iup</strong>&quot;.</pre>

<p>As a general rule (excluding system dependencies): IUP depends on CD and IM, 
and IUPLua depends on Lua, CDLua and IMLua. Notice that not all IUP libraries 
depend on CD and IM.</p>
<p>Instead of building all the libraries, try building only the libraries you 
are going to use. The Makefile on the root folder will build all the libraries, 
but in each source folder there are secondary Makefiles. We use the following 
source code structure:</p>
<pre>iup/
    src/         - The core library. Motif, GTK and Windows code
    srccd/       - CD_IUP canvas driver for the CD library
    srcconsole/  - Lua interpreter executable with pre-loaded IUP, CD and IM libraries
    srcgl/       - IupGLCanvas
    srcim/       - IUP/IM utilities
    srcimglib/   - Image Libraries with Icons, Logos and Bitmaps
    srcledc/     - ledc executable
    srclua3      - Lua3 binding, used internally at Tecgraf by some applications
    srclua5/     - Lua 5 binding
    srcole/      - IupOleControl
    srcpplot/    - IupPPlot
    srctuio/     - IupTuioClient
    srcweb/      - IupWebBrowser
    srcview/     - IupView executable</pre>
<p>The Lua bindings for IUP, CD and IM (Makefiles and Pre-compiled binaries) 
depend on the <a href="http://luabinaries.luaforge.net/">LuaBinaries</a> 
distribution. So if you are going to build from source, then use the <strong>LuaBinaries</strong> 
source package also, not the <strong>Lua.org</strong> original source package. 
If you like to use another location for the Lua files define LUA_SUFFIX, LUA_INC, 
LUA_LIB and LUA_BIN before using Tecmake.</p>
<p>In Ubuntu you will need to install the following packages and their 
dependencies (they are not installed by default):</p>
<pre>libgtk2.0-dev (for the GTK driver)
    libmotif-dev and x11proto-print-dev (for the Motif driver, if used)
libgl1-mesa-dev (for the IupGLCanvas)
libglu1-mesa-dev (for the IupGLCanvas)
libwebkitgtk-dev (for the IupWebBrowser)
</pre>
<h3><a name="cpp">Using IUP in C++</a></h3>
<p>IUP is a low level API, but at the same time a very simple and intuitive API. 
That's why it is implemented in C, to keep the API simple. But most of the 
actual IUP applications today use C++. To use C callbacks in C++ classes, you 
can declare the callbacks as static members or friend functions, and store the 
pointer &quot;this&quot; at the &quot;Ihandle*&quot; pointer as an user attribute. For example, you 
can create your dialog by inheriting from the following dialog.</p>
<pre>class iupDialog
{
private:
  Ihandle *hDlg;
  int test;

  static int ResizeCB (Ihandle* self, int w, int h); 
  friend int ShowCB(Ihandle *self, int mode); 

public:
  iupDialog(Ihandle* child)
  { 
    hDlg = IupDialog(child); 
    IupSetAttribute(hDlg, &quot;iupDialog&quot;, (char*)this); 
    IupSetCallback(hDlg, &quot;RESIZE_CB&quot;, (Icallback)ResizeCB);
    IupSetCallback(hDlg, &quot;SHOW_CB&quot;, (Icallback)ShowCB);
  }

  void ShowXY(int x, int y) { IupShowXY(hDlg, x, y); }

protected:

  // implement this to use your own callbacks
  virtual void Show(int mode) {};
  virtual void Resize (int w, int h){}; 
};

int iupDialog::ResizeCB(Ihandle *self, int w, int h)
{
  iupDialog *d = (iupDialog*)IupGetAttribute(self, &quot;iupDialog&quot;);
  d-&gt;test = 1; // private members can be accessed in private static members
  d-&gt;Resize(w, h);
  return IUP_DEFAULT;
}

int ShowCB(Ihandle *self, int mode)
{
  iupDialog *d = (iupDialog*)IupGetAttribute(self, &quot;iupDialog&quot;);
  d-&gt;test = 1; // private members can be accessed in private friend functions
  d-&gt;Show(mode);
  return IUP_DEFAULT;
}</pre>
<p>This is just one possibility on how to write a wrapper class around IUP 
functions. Some users contributed with C++ wrappers, see next on <strong>

<p>Described by his words:<br>
<em>IUP is not designed to be accessed from multiple threads, but occasionally 
there is a need (especially in a multi-threaded application) for the UI to 
update a display or dispatch an action in response to messages from other 
threads or from an OS component. To address this need, we designed an IUP 
control that translates calls from any application thread into a callback 
function guaranteed to be running in IUP's thread. <br>
The IupAsync control is presently an alpha release proving the concept for the 
Windows platform only. It is intended that it be ported to the other platforms 
supported by IUP (GTK and Motif for Linux and OSX).</em></p>
