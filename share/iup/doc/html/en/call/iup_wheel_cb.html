<h2>WHEEL_CB</h2>
<p>Action generated when the mouse wheel is 
  rotated. If this callback is not defined the wheel will automatically scroll the canvas in the vertical 
  direction by some lines, the SCROLL_CB callback if defined will be called with the IUP_SBDRAGV operation.</p>
<h3>Callback</h3>
<pre>int function(Ihandle *<strong>ih</strong>, float <b>delta</b>, int <strong>x</strong>, int <strong>y</strong>, char *<strong>status</strong>); [in C]
<strong>elem</strong>:wheel_cb(<strong>delta, x</strong>, <strong>y</strong>: number, <strong>status</strong>: string) -&gt; (<strong>ret</strong>: number) [in Lua]</pre>
<p><strong>ih</strong>:
  identifier of the element that activated the event.<br>
<b>delta</b>: the amount the wheel was rotated in notches.<br>
<strong>x</strong>, <strong>y</strong>:
  position in the canvas where the event has 
  occurred, in pixels.<br>
<strong>status</strong>: status of mouse buttons and certain keyboard keys at 
the moment the event was generated. The same macros used for
<a href="../call/iup_button_cb.html">BUTTON_CB</a> can be used for this status.</p>
<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>In Motif and GTK delta is always 1 or -1. In Windows is some situations delta can reach the value of two. In the future with 
  more precise wheels this increment can be changed.</p>
<p>The wheel will only work if the focus is at the canvas.</p>
