<h2>K_ANY</h2>
<p>Action generated when a keyboard event 
  occurs.</p>
<h3>Callback</h3>
<pre>int function(Ihandle *<strong>ih</strong>, int <strong>c</strong>); [in C]
<strong>elem</strong>:k_any(<strong>c</strong>: number) -&gt; (<strong>ret</strong>: number) [in Lua]</pre>
<p><strong>ih</strong>:
  identifier of the element that activated the event.<br>
<strong>c</strong>:
  identifier of typed key. Please refer to the
  <a href="../attrib/key.html">Keyboard Codes</a>
  table for a list of possible values.</p>
<p><u>Returns</u>: If IUP_IGNORE is returned the key is ignored and not 
processed by the control and not propagated. If returns IUP_CONTINUE, the key will be processed and the event will be 
propagated to the parent of the element receiving it, this is the default 
behavior. If returns
  IUP_DEFAULT the key is processed but it is not propagated. IUP_CLOSE will be 
processed. </p>
<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>Keyboard callbacks depend on the keyboard usage of the control with the focus. 
So if you return IUP_IGNORE the control will usually not process the key. But be 
aware that sometimes the control process the key in another event so even 
returning IUP_IGNORE the key can get processed. Although it will not be 
propagated.</p>
<p><span class="style1">IMPORTANT</span>: The callbacks &quot;K_*&quot; of the dialog or 
native containers depend on the IUP_CONTINUE return value to work while the 
control is in focus.</p>
<p>If the callback does not exists it is automatically propagated to the parent of the element.</p>
<h4>K_* callbacks</h4>
<p>All defined keys are also callbacks of any 
  element, called when the respective key is activated. For example: &quot;K_cC&quot; is also a callback activated when the user 
  press Ctrl+C, when the focus is at the element or at a children with focus. This is the way an application can create shortcut keys, also called 
  hot keys. These callbacks are not available in IupLua.</p>
<h3>Affects</h3>
<p>All elements with keyboard interaction.</p>
