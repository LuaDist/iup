<h2>Motif System Driver</h2>
<p>Driver for the X-Windows/Motif 2.x environment.</p>
<h3>Environment Variables</h3>
<p><b>DEBUG</b></p>
<p class="info">This variables existence makes the driver 
    operate in synchronous mode with the X server. This slows down all operations, but allows immediately detecting 
    errors caused by X.</p>
<h3><b>
Default Values  Resource Files</b>
</h3>
<p>Some default values used by the driver, such 
  as background color, foreground color and font, can be set by the user by means of a resource file called &quot;Iup&quot;. It must be in the users home or in a directory pointed to by the XAPPLRESDIR environment variable. Below you can see an example of this files contents:</p>
<pre>*background: #ff0000
*foreground: #a0ff00
*fontList: -misc-fixed-bold-r-normal-*-13-*</pre>
<p>The values used in the example above are the 
  ones used by IUP if these resources are not defined.</p>
<p>Also a resource file named &quot;.Xdefaults&quot; will also affect the visual appearance of all 
applications that use Motif and Intrinsics.</p>
<h3>Tips</h3>

<h4>Dynamic Libraries in Linux</h4>

<p>When using dynamic libraries in Linux, the &quot;libiup.so&quot; uses the GTK driver 
for newer systems (Linux26g4). So 
applications that dynamically load IUP will always use the &quot;libiup.so&quot;, for 
example Lua using require. To use the IUP Motif dynamic library in Linux you must rename the 
&quot;libiupmot.so&quot; to &quot;libiup.so&quot;, so the Motif driver will be loaded instead of the 
GTK 
driver.</p>
<p>In older systems (&lt;=Linux26 with gcc 3) the &quot;libiup.so&quot; already contains the 
Motif driver.</p>
<h4>During linking in the Solaris 
  environment: Can not find <b>libresolv.so.2</b></h4>
<p>This error occurs if the system does not 
  have an applied patch containing this library.</p>
<p>This library is important for all 
  installations of Solaris 2.5 and 2.5.1 (SunOS 5.5 and 5.5.1, respectively). It is a correction of the DNS system, 
  involving security.</p>
<p>The web address to get these patches is 
  SunSolves <a href="http://sunsolve1.sun.com/sunsolve/pubpatches/patches.html">http://sunsolve1.sun.com/sunsolve/pubpatches/patches.html</a>.
  Select the Solaris version you wish (2.5 or 
  2.5.1 for Sparc) and download the patches 103667-09, 102980-17, 103279-03, 103708-02, or more recent for 2.5 (the number after 
  the - is the patch version, and the more recent number is the patch), or 103663-12, 103594-14, 103680-02 and 
  103686-02 for 2.5.1.
  All of them have a README file explaining 
  installation, and groups have to be installed together.</p>
<h4>TrueColor canvas</h4>
<p>Whenever a canvas is created, one tries to 
  create it with a TrueColor resolution Visual. This is not always possible, since it is subject to many conditions, 
  such as hardware (graphics board) and the X servers configuration.</p>
<p>The <b>xdpyinfo</b> program informs which Visuals are available in the X server where the display is being 
  made, so that you can see if your X allows creating a canvas with a TrueColor Visual. In some platforms, however, the 
  X server may not make a TrueColor Visual available, even though the graphics board is able to display it. In this 
  case, restart the server with parameters that force this. Below is a table with such parameters to some systems where 
  the IUP library has been tested. If the command does not work, or if it is not possible, then the graphics library 
  really does not support 24 bpp.</p>
  <table align="center">
    <tr>
      <th>System</th>
      <th>Execution Command</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Linux</td>
      <td>startx --bpp 24</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>AIX</td>
      <td>(not necessary)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>IRIX</td>
      <td>(not necessary)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Solaris</td>
      <td>(not necessary)</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
<p>Since color requests are always successful 
  in TrueColor/24bpp windows, we have minimized visualization problems for images that make use of complex color 
  palettes (when there is a high color demand, not always all colors requested can be obtained). The IUP applications 
  also coexist more peacefully with other applications and among themselves, since the colors used by TrueColor/24bpp 
  windows do not use the colormap cells used by all applications.</p>
<h4>XtAddCallback failed</h4>
<p>When a warning about XtAddCallback appears during the application initialization, and it aborts, this usually means 
  that you are using a Motif with a different version than the Motif used to build IUP. Reinstall Motif or rebuild IUP 
  using your Motif.</p>
<h4>Some Control Sizes are wrong (IUP 2.x only)</h4>
<p>Sometimes the control initialization is incomplete and its size is miscalculated. To solve this call IupMap(dialog) 
  and set the dialog size to NULL &quot;IupSetAttribute(dlg, IUP_SIZE, NULL);&quot; before calling IupShow. 
This will fix the sizes.</p>

<h4><font SIZE="3">Indigo Magic look in Sgi</font></h4>
<font SIZE="3">
<p>To turn on the Indigo Magic look for an application, simply set the 
applications sgiMode resource to TRUE. Typically, you should add this line to 
the &quot;/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults&quot; file for your application:</p>
<p>appName*sgiMode: TRUE</p>
<p>where appName is the name of your application.</p>
