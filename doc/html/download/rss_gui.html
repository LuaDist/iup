<h1>RSSGui - A C++ wrapper for the IUP GUI&nbsp;toolkit</h1>
<blockquote>
  <p>This is a short introduction to the GUI tookit RSSGui which is a simple and 
  easy to use C++ wrapper for the ANSI C GUI toolkit IUP.</p>
  <p>The current version of RSSGui is 0.5. This release contains wrappers for 
  most of the IUP widgets and adds a widget type that can be used to create 
  wizards. Not all events and functions availabe in IUP are already wrapped by 
  RSSGui, but the event handling mechanism is very simple and easy to extend. If 
  you miss somethin, please tell <a href="mailto:dr@rsas.de">me</a>. The current 
  version is only tested on the Windows platform. If you can successfully use it 
  on any other platform or if you have any problems anywhere, please tell me!</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>The goals</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>I know a lot of C++ GUI toolkits. Most of them have some drawbacks: Either 
  they come with a lot of classes that represent strings, lists, vectors etc. 
  which are already defined in a wunderful way in the C++ STL, they don't use 
  native widgets or they have a complicated and error prone event handling (like 
  MFC or wxWidgets) or they use language extensions (like Qt). So my goals when 
  designing RSSGui where:</p>
  <p>Simplicity</p>
  <ul>
    <li type="square">STL conformance, compatibility and interoperability </li>
    <li type="square">A simple yet powerful event handling mechanism </li>
    <li type="square">Native C++, no language extensions </li>
    <li type="square">Completely free for comeracial as for non comercial usage
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>I think I reached these goals quite good. The event handling is really 
  simple and easy to understand as well as easy to use. Unfortunately it is not 
  typesafe. It could have been realized in a type safe way as I saw it in a 
  signal and slot library that I found on the web. But, well - I don't consider 
  type safety as a primary design goal, so I am happy with the current design.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Some examples</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>If you are still interested in using RSSGui for your applications, please 
  have a look at the following examples...</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Basics</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>The only file you need to include is <code>RSSGui.h</code>. You don't need 
  to include any IUP headers if you don't want to use IUP functions directly. At 
  the beginning of your program you should call the function <code>rssGuiInit()</code> 
  and at the end <code>rssGuiRelease()</code>. Just by the way: You can use IUP 
  functions directly on your RSSGui widgets - you can receive a widget pointer 
  by calling the method <code>getHandle()</code> and cast the returned pointer 
  from <code>void *</code> to <code>Ihandle *</code>, but this is not really 
  tested or suggested...</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Example 1: Creating a a dialog with a button</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>This simple example creates a dialog, places a button on it and starts the 
  main event loop (but doesn't use an event handler):</p>
  <pre>#include &quot;RSSGui.h&quot;

int main()
{
  rssGuiInit(); 

  // create a dialog with a simple button
  RSSButton *b1 = new RSSButton(&quot;Click me!&quot;);
  RSSDialog *d1 = new RSSDialog(b1, &quot;RSSGui Example&quot;); 

  // set a tool tip for the button
  b1-&gt;setToolTip(&quot;A cool button&quot;); 

  // show the dialog
  d1-&gt;show(); 

  // Start the main event loop
  RSSEventManager *eventManager = RSSEventManager::getInstance();
  eventManager-&gt;mainLoop(); 

  delete d1; 

  rssGuiRelease();
  return 0;
}</pre>
  <p>The button gets a tool tip simply by calling the method <code>setToolTip()</code> 
  that is inherited from <code>RSSWidget</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Example 2: Event handler</h3>
<blockquote>
  <pre>#include &quot;RSSGui.h&quot;

class MyDialog : RSSEventHandler
{
public:
  int button1Event(RSSEvent &amp;event)
  {
    static int flag = 0;
    flag = 1 - flag; // toggle between 0 and 1

    ((RSSButton *)(event.getWidget()))-&gt;setLabel(flag ? &quot;text1&quot; : &quot;text2&quot;);
    return RSSGUIDEFAULT;
  }

  int button2Event(RSSEvent &amp;event)
  {
    return RSSGUICLOSE;
  }

  void doIt()
  {
    // create a dialog with a simple button
    RSSButton *b1 = new RSSButton(&quot;Button 1&quot;);
    RSSButton *b2 = new RSSButton(&quot;Close&quot;);
    RSSVBox *v1 = new RSSVBox(b1, b2, 0);
    RSSDialog *d1 = new RSSDialog(v1, &quot;RSSGui Example&quot;);

    // set tool tips for the buttons
    b1-&gt;setToolTip(&quot;A cool button&quot;);
    b2-&gt;setToolTip(&quot;Close this wunderful application&quot;);

    // show the dialog
    d1-&gt;show();

    // register the event handlers
    rssRegisterEvent(b1, MyDialog::button1Event);
    rssRegisterEvent(b2, MyDialog::button2Event);

    // Start the main event loop
    RSSEventManager *eventManager = RSSEventManager::getInstance();
    eventManager-&gt;mainLoop();

    delete d1;
  }
};

int main()
{
  rssGuiInit();

  MyDialog d;
  d.doIt();

  rssGuiRelease();
  return 0;
}</pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>An event handler is a method in a class that is derived from <code>
  RSSEventHandler</code>. All event handlers are methods that receive an 
  argument of type <code>RSSEvent</code> and that return an integer value. This 
  return value controls if the application should be continued or terminated 
  etc. - exactly as in IUP itself. The class RSSEvent has a lot of member 
  functions that you can use to access information about the event. For example 
  you can use the method <code>getWidget()</code> to access the widget that 
  caused the event - in this case the button that has been clicked.</p>
  <p>The idea of the event handling mechanism is really simple - call the macro
  <code>rssRegisterEvent</code> and connect an event handler to an event type of 
  a widget. That's it. No magic macros in your headers that are similarly 
  repeated in the implementation files and no language extension. Simply calling 
  a macro to connect the event and the event handler.</p>
